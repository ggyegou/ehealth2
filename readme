This is source code of Ehealth Task2
The project is developed and tested under python3.5 and windows-x64. We chose pycharm as our IDE.
To finish this task, we crawled title and abstract of each pid including in each topic file from PubMed.
We also downloaded pre-trained word vectors on https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/wordvecs. We chose glove.840B.300d.zip	.
The pre-processed crawled data and topic files could be found on our Google drive:
